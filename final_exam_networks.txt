R22.) What is the 32-bit binary equivalent of the IP address 223.1.3.27

11011111.00000001.00000011.00011011

R27.) What is meant by the term "route aggregation"? Why is it useful for a router to perform route
aggregation?

The ability to use a single prefix to advertise multiple networks is often referred to as route aggregation.
This is useful because an ISP can use this technique to advertise to the rest of the internet a single prefix
address for the multiple networks that the ISP has.


R31.) It has been said that when IPv6 Tunnels through IPv4 routers, IPv6 treats the IPv4 tunnels as link-layer
protocols. Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not?

Yes - when IPv6 tunnels through IPv4 routers, IPv6 treats the IPv4 tunnels as link-layer protocols. This is
because the IPv6 datagram is fully encapsulated in an IPv4 datagram.

P15.) Suppose datagrams are limited to 1,500 bytes (including header) between source Host A and destination Host B.
Assuming a 20-byte IP header, how many datagrams would be required to send an MP3 consisiting of 5 million bytes?
Explain how you computed your answer.
